# Forest-fire-prediction
In this course project I have used the forestfires dataset. I have done forest fire prediction using ML. First, I have done the EDA followed by dataset visualization. Then I have done statistical analysis on the dataset to understand the distribution of the area and the burn area values. I splitted the dataset and applied Linear Regression then I got the regression metrics and the predicted outcome.
